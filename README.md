# lisy.app

> A website about a girl named Lisy.  
> She was supposed to stay on the page.  
> She didnâ€™t.  

Now thereâ€™s an app, a universe, and no clear way backâ€”as Mose Njo used to say, before Lisy took over.

This repository contains the code that powers [https://lisy.app](https://lisy.app), a digital doorway into the Lisy universe: stories, voices, secrets, and curious adventures in Malagasy and French.

## ðŸ§­ What's inside
- HTML/CSS/JS for the public-facing website
- Character teasers, subtle foreshadowing, and very little to none marketing
- A stubborn refusal to explain Lisy too early

## ðŸ›  Tech used
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- No frameworks (yet)
- One foot in reality, the other somewhere else entirely

> This site is part of a growing creative ecosystem built by [Mose Njo](https://mosenjo.com), a writer from Madagascar who claims to follow Lisyâ€™s lead, though evidence suggests otherwise.
